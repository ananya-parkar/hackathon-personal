Here is a complete, step-by-step summary of all updates, installations, and code file changes you have made to your pipeline:

Firstly, run command: pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Libraries and Tools Installed/Configured

- **sentence-transformers** (for original embedding model)
- **optimum[onnxruntime]** and **onnxruntime** (for ONNX model and quantization)
- **transformers** (for model/tokenizer loading)
- **faiss** (for vector search)
- **pytesseract** (for OCR)
- **Pillow** (for image processing)
- **PyPDF2** (for PDF text extraction)
- **python-docx** (for DOCX text extraction)
- **langdetect** (for language detection)
- **streamlit** (for the UI)
- **Tesseract OCR engine** (installed on Windows system)
- **Google Colab** (used for initial model download and ONNX conversion)

2. Major Code Updates (Features/Logic)

- Quantized ONNX Embedding Model
  - Downloaded, quantized, and loaded a multilingual SentenceTransformer model in ONNX format for fast, local embedding.
  - Created `onnx_embedder.py` to provide a drop-in `encode()` for all embedding needs.


- Integrated ONNX Embeddings in Pipeline
  - Replaced SentenceTransformer usage with ONNX-based embedding in `retrieval.py`, `process.py`, and `process_grad.py`.

- Logging Functionality
  - Added `logger.py` to log every Q&A interaction with timestamp, query, answer, sources, and detected language.
  - Integrated logging calls after every Q&A in `app_ananya.py` and `app_gradio_ananya.py`.

- Prompt Engineering for Multilingual Answers
  - Updated prompt construction to instruct the LLM to answer in the same language as the question.
  - Placed the instruction immediately before the answer in the prompt for best results.

- OCR Support for Image Files
  - Enhanced `extract_text_from_file` in `utils.py` to extract text from images using pytesseract (with preprocessing).
  - Added code to set `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` to the correct Tesseract executable path.
  - Provided instructions for installing and configuring Tesseract OCR on Windows.

- Debugging and Diagnostics
  - Added print statements in `app_ananya.py` to log OCR output, chunking output, and retrieval results for troubleshooting.

- Language Detection
  - Integrated language detection (`detect_language`) in Q&A prompt construction to support multilingual answers.

- Switched Ollama Model to Llama 3
  - Updated `ollama_handler.py` to use `llama3` for better multilingual support instead of `phi`.

- Streamlit UI Enhancements
  - Improved file upload, question input, and answer/entity display in the Streamlit interface.
